MVC---
Stands for Model/View/Controller.
Is a software architectural pattern for implementing UI.
Divides given software application into three parts.
Very popular for web applications.
Model directly manages the data, logic, rules of application and also stores retrieved data for view.
View is an informational output of Model such as a chart or diagram to user.
Controller acccepts user input and manipulates the Model state (ex. edit document) or View (ex. scroll down in document).

Business Delegate---
Is a programming pattern often used in J2EE for multi-tiered, distributed systems.
Deals with the issue of presentation-tier clients (devices, web clients, etc.) directly interfacing with business service APIs.
Direct interfacing causes client/presentation-tier components to become vulnerable to changes in business services.
Direct interfacing may also hurt network performance when presentation-tier components make too many calls to business service API over network.
